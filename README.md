# CheckPDriveFilesLength
App that scans a drive to check which files name length exceed Windows file name length

This app grew up to be something different from what was initially intended, so its code isn't the prettiest, but it works, and the company's IT manager and I are the only user, so we're just happy this is doing its job properly.
